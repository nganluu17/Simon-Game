## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

https://codepen.io/althi/pen/eKdmaa
I used the above website to create the hover effect for start/stop buttons. 
https://www.pinterest.com/marimoon/aesthetic-color-palette/
I used the above link to choose the colors for website. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The most difficult challenge that I encountered in creating this game is choosing the color and effect for the buttons. I want the website to have an aesthetic look. However, designing is not easy and required me few minutes to search on Pinterest for ideas. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I questioned myself for having a database for this game. To improve the game from the back-end, it should have the unlimited pattern which create the ranking system. Players will stay longer and the game will become competitive. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

If I can have a few more hours to work on this, I will finish all the optional functions. Moreover, I want to create a text message for each time player loses. For example, as a drinking game for party, the person who lost will get an extra drink.
